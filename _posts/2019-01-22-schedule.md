In the midst of COVID-19, we here at Animation Anteaters believe it is more important than ever to stay connected. So, we have a lot of summer activities planned for the club. You can look forward to:

* the annual Summer Art Exchange (June)
* finishing Colorful (July-August)
* and movie nights every Saturday

A majority of these activities will be hosted on our Discord! Please contact us for an invite. We will also be restarting our other social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube) to make it easier to stay connected no matter anyone's social media preference.
