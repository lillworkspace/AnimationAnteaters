A zombie apocalypse survivor thinks it's all over when a zombie baby attaches herself to his leg, but the zombie baby doesn't bite him! However, she doesn't let go either... This short is about the many shenanigans that follow.

Interested? We are working on:
* Storyboarding
* Character/Background art
* Keyframing

and we could use your help!

Continue to keep an eye on this post, as we may have a storyboard/progress video soon!
