Animation Anteaters will be at ZotCon Online this Saturday, November 21st. Come visit our virtual booth or tune into our animation panel! Find out more about the event [here][1].

We are excited to announce that we have also opened a RedBubble store for this occasion. We are fundraising for the Fallen Fire Fighter Relief Fund, in support of the two firefighters who were injured while fighting the Silverado Fire that recently affected UCI in October.
